# Release Instructions for v1.6.0

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note for Background Agent

As a background agent in this remote environment, I have prepared all release artifacts but cannot perform certain git operations directly. The following instructions are for manual execution or will be handled by the environment's automated workflows.

## ‚úÖ Completed Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Version Update**: Updated to v1.6.0 in:
   - `pyproject.toml` (version and server_version)
   - `tree_sitter_analyzer/__init__.py`

2. ‚úÖ **CHANGELOG Update**: Added comprehensive v1.6.0 release notes to `CHANGELOG.md`

3. ‚úÖ **README Updates**: Updated all three README versions:
   - `README.md` (English)
   - `README_zh.md` (Chinese)
   - `README_ja.md` (Japanese)

4. ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Created release documentation:
   - `RELEASE_v1.6.0.md` - Comprehensive release notes
   - `RELEASE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - This file

## üìã Manual Steps Required

### Step 1: Create Release Branch (Following GitFlow)

According to `GITFLOW_zh.md`, create a release branch from develop:

```bash
# Ensure you're on develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create release branch
git checkout -b release/v1.6.0
```

### Step 2: Verify Changes

Review all changes:
```bash
git status
git diff develop

# Ensure all version updates are correct
grep -r "1.6.0" pyproject.toml tree_sitter_analyzer/__init__.py README*.md
```

### Step 3: Run Quality Checks

```bash
# Run tests (if environment allows)
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run quality checks
python check_quality.py

# Verify version synchronization
python scripts/sync_version_minimal.py --check
```

### Step 4: Commit Changes

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add pyproject.toml tree_sitter_analyzer/__init__.py CHANGELOG.md README.md README_zh.md README_ja.md RELEASE_v1.6.0.md RELEASE_INSTRUCTIONS.md

# Commit with release message
git commit -m "release: prepare v1.6.0 with enterprise Python support and file output

- Enhanced Python language support matching Java/JavaScript capabilities
- Added file output feature for analyze_code_structure
- Added JSON output format support
- Updated documentation with new features
- 439+ new tests for enhanced functionality
- Full backward compatibility maintained"
```

### Step 5: Push Release Branch

```bash
# Push release branch to remote
git push origin release/v1.6.0
```

### Step 6: Automated Workflows

According to `GITFLOW_zh.md`, pushing to `release/v*` branch will trigger:

1. **Testing**: Full test suite with coverage reporting
2. **Building**: Package building and validation
3. **PyPI Deployment**: Automatic deployment to PyPI
4. **PR Creation**: Automatic PR to main branch

Wait for automated workflows to complete.

### Step 7: Create Git Tag

After successful PyPI deployment:

```bash
# Create annotated tag
git tag -a v1.6.0 -m "Release v1.6.0: Enterprise Python Support & File Output

Major Features:
- Enterprise-grade Python support matching Java/JavaScript capabilities
- File output feature with automatic format detection
- Enhanced JSON output format support
- 439+ new tests, 71.90%+ coverage

See CHANGELOG.md for full details."

# Push tag to remote
git push origin v1.6.0
```

### Step 8: Merge to Main and Develop

Following GitFlow:

```bash
# Merge to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge release/v1.6.0
git push origin main

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git merge release/v1.6.0
git push origin develop

# Delete release branch (optional)
git branch -d release/v1.6.0
git push origin --delete release/v1.6.0
```

### Step 9: Create GitHub Release

1. Go to https://github.com/aimasteracc/tree-sitter-analyzer/releases/new
2. Select tag: `v1.6.0`
3. Release title: `v1.6.0 - Enterprise Python Support & File Output`
4. Description: Copy contents from `RELEASE_v1.6.0.md`
5. Upload any additional assets if needed
6. Mark as latest release
7. Publish release

### Step 10: Verify PyPI Package

```bash
# Check PyPI package
pip index versions tree-sitter-analyzer

# Test installation
pip install tree-sitter-analyzer==1.6.0

# Verify version
python -c "import tree_sitter_analyzer; print(tree_sitter_analyzer.__version__)"
```
