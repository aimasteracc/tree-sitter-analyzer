"""``edit`` facade — Wave B facade for edit/safety/impact capabilities.

Folds eight code-safety and change-management capabilities behind one
``action`` parameter:

============  ==============================  ================================
action        inner tool                      when to use
============  ==============================  ================================
safe          ``safe_to_edit``                Pre-edit safety gate (SAFE/UNSAFE)
guard         ``modification_guard``          Blast-radius guard before touching a symbol
impact        ``analyze_change_impact``       Post-edit dependency blast-radius scan
refactor      ``refactoring_suggestions``     Refactoring opportunities for a file
constraints   ``check_constraints``           Constraint violations in the project
pr            ``codegraph_pr_review``         AI review of a PR diff via CodeGraph
classify      ``semantic_classify``           Semantic classification of a symbol/file
ast_diff      ``ast_diff``                    Structural diff of two AST snapshots
============  ==============================  ================================

Annotation honesty (spec §6 / review §8 F-extra-3):
    This facade spans READ-ONLY actions (``safe``, ``impact``, ``classify``,
    ``constraints``, ``pr``, ``ast_diff``) and MUTATING-INTENT actions
    (``refactor`` suggests changes; ``guard`` checks before a write). A single
    honest ``readOnlyHint=True`` is IMPOSSIBLE for this facade — doing so would
    violate the ``test_every_tool_declares_mcp_annotations`` contract which
    forbids ``readOnly AND destructive``. We therefore set
    ``readOnlyHint=False, destructiveHint=False`` (it suggests / analyses,
    does not actually write files), ``idempotentHint=False`` (analysis results
    may differ as the index updates), ``openWorldHint=False``. Read actions lose
    the read-safe signal — accepted tradeoff per PRD §4. If a strict read-only
    sub-facade is later needed, split ``safe``/``impact``/``classify`` into a
    separate read-only facade (out of scope for Wave B).

Not registered in ``_tool_registry.py`` at P0; Wave C handles cutover.

    "dependency graph: affected files, must-run tests, risk verdict (SAFE/REVIEW/WARN). "
    "Call after every non-trivial edit. Params: scope_paths, output_format.\n"
    "- action=refactor — refactoring-opportunity analysis for a source file: extract "
    "candidates, complexity hotspots, skeleton. Params: file_path, language, "
    "max_suggestions, include_extractions, include_skeleton, output_format.\n"
    "- action=constraints — scan the project for constraint/rule violations "
    "(architecture, naming, coupling). Params: severity_min, output_format.\n"
    "- action=pr — AI review of a PR diff via CodeGraph: structural issues, "
    "blast-radius, test-coverage gaps. Params: pr_url or diff (see inner schema).\n"
    "- action=classify — semantic classification of a symbol or file: domain, "
    "layer, responsibility. Params: file_path or symbol, output_format.\n"
    "- action=ast_diff — structural AST diff between two snapshots/versions of "
    "a file: added/removed/changed nodes. Params: file_path, before, after or "
