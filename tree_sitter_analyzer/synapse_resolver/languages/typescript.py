"""TypeScript per-language callee resolver (RFC-0010, first wave).

Self-contained and SAFE. Replaces the Python cascade for ``.ts``/``.tsx`` callers
(``file_languages == "typescript"``) without regressing: it resolves SAME-FILE/
SAME-LANGUAGE local calls, classifies a small, distinctive set of built-in global
objects as ``builtin``, binds a call through an ES-module import the binder can
prove (#1764: named / default / namespace imports, re-exports through barrel files,
the project's own package specifiers) as ``project``, and returns ``unknown`` for
everything else.

THE MOAT — never cross-language bind. ``_project_owns`` is language-aware: a
same-named symbol in an incompatible-language file (e.g. a Python ``console``)
never counts as an owner and is never bound, because
``languages_compatible("typescript", "python")`` is False. JS/TS dialects are one
family, so a ``.js`` owner does count (gradual-migration repos cross-import).

Conservative tiers only (the RFC-0008 lesson): the bare-method-name stdlib/
external tables are EMPTY by design — generic JS method names (``map``/``push``/
``substring``/``then``) collide with domain methods and, without receiver-type
inference, would be mis-classified. They stay ``unknown``, which is correct.

Contract (RFC-0010): the module ends with
``register_language("typescript", build_typescript_resolver_context,
resolve_typescript_callee)``.
