## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in Tree-sitter Analyzer, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email the maintainers directly or use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/aimasteracc/tree-sitter-analyzer/security/advisories/new)
3. Include as much detail as possible:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 24-48 hours
  - High: 7 days
  - Medium: 30 days
  - Low: 90 days

### Safe Harbor

We will not pursue legal action against security researchers who:
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption of services
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission
- Report vulnerabilities through our responsible disclosure process
- Give us reasonable time to address issues before public disclosure

## Security Best Practices

When using Tree-sitter Analyzer:
- Always use the latest version
- Review third-party plugins before use
- Run in isolated environments when analyzing untrusted code
